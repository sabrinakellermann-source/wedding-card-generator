Of course. That's the perfect next step. Handing off the planning documents to the development team is a key part of the BMAD process.

Here are the complete **Project Brief** and the **AI Core PoC Technical Plan**. You can use these to set up your project in Replit and guide your initial development sprints.

### **Project Brief: Pinterest-Powered Wedding Invitation Generator**

**1. Project Overview & Vision (Revised)**
*   **Project Name:** Pinterest-Powered Wedding Invitation Generator (Prototype)
*   **Vision:** To empower creatively-driven couples to effortlessly transform their curated wedding inspiration into a 100% personalized, professionally printed wedding invitation.
*   **Summary:** This project will develop a **prototype** to validate a new feature for `kartenmacherei.de`. The feature allows users to input a Pinterest board URL. The tool will use AI to perform a visual and stylistic analysis of the board's images, focusing on **dominant color palettes and overall style (e.g., 'boho', 'modern')** for the MVP. Based on this analysis, it will automatically generate a unique wedding invitation design. The generated design will be loaded into the `kartenmacherei.de` configurator, allowing users to fine-tune it before purchase. The key differentiator is the seamless integration of AI-driven personalization into a trusted e-commerce platform.
*   **Business Goal:** Increase `kartenmacherei.de` revenue by simplifying the personalization process, increasing conversion rates, and enhancing user engagement.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Prototype:**
    *   **Validation Rate:** Percentage of users who generate a card and proceed to the configurator.
    *   **Time-to-Configurator:** The time it takes from URL input to the design being loaded (target < 30 seconds).
    *   **User Satisfaction Score:** A post-experience survey to gauge the "magic moment" and perceived quality.
*   **Open Questions & Assumptions:**
    *   **Technical Feasibility:** We assume the Pinterest API provides sufficient data and that an AI model can perform the analysis within our time and cost constraints. This requires a technical investigation.
    *   **User Experience:** The "reveal" of the generated card is a critical moment. The prototype must include options to "try again" or "start over" to manage user expectations gracefully.
    *   **Integration:** We assume the `kartenmacherei.de` configurator has an API or other mechanism to accept a structured set of design elements. This needs to be confirmed.

**2. Target Audience & User Persona**
*   **Target Audience:** Tech-savvy brides or grooms (ages 28-35) who are active `kartenmacherei.de` users. They are design-conscious and have a well-defined aesthetic for their wedding, which they have curated on a Pinterest board. They value personalization and uniqueness but may lack the technical skills or time to create a design from scratch.
*   **User Persona: "Creative Clara"**
    *   **Who She Is:** Clara is a 32-year-old marketing manager planning her wedding. She is highly organized and has spent months creating a detailed Pinterest board named "Our Dream Wedding."
    *   **Her Goal:** She wants her wedding invitations to be the perfect first impression, perfectly matching the vision she has so carefully curated.
    *   **Her Frustration:** *"I've already done the creative work on my Pinterest board! I wish I could just connect it to kartenmacherei.de and have it create the perfect starting point for me."*

**3. Features & Scope (Revised)**
*   **In Scope: Core Prototype (MVP) Features**
    1.  **Pinterest Board Input:** A simple UI field for a public Pinterest board URL.
    2.  **Advanced AI Analysis:** Detailed analysis of images to extract color palettes, style, mood, key motifs, and typographic feel.
    3.  **High-Fidelity Card Generation:** Generation of a unique, high-quality design that is aligned with `kartenmacherei.de`'s brand standards.
    4.  **Configurator Integration:** The generated design loads seamlessly and is fully editable.
    5.  **Regeneration Option:** A "Try Again" button.
*   **Out of Scope for Prototype**
    *   Exact font matching.
    *   Full stationery suite generation.
    *   Direct Pinterest login.
    *   Printing and fulfillment.

**4. Success Metrics & Technical Approach**
*   **Success Metrics for Prototype**
    *   **User Value:** >4.0/5.0 "Wow-Factor" rating; >50% "Proceed-to-Edit" rate.
    *   **Technical Feasibility:** >95% generation success rate; <30 seconds average generation time.
*   **Technical Approach: Phased Proof of Concept (PoC)**
    *   **Phase 1: AI Core PoC (1-2 Sprints):** Focus exclusively on proving the AI pipeline can produce a high-quality, brand-aligned, and structured design output (JSON).
    *   **Phase 2: Prototype Development:** Build the UI and integrate the successful PoC. This phase only begins if the PoC is successful.

### **AI Core PoC: Technical Plan**

**Objective:** To prove that a Pinterest board URL can be reliably converted into a structured JSON object representing a high-quality, brand-aligned wedding invitation design.

**Step 1: Pinterest Image Extraction**
*   **Method:** Build a Python script using `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` to scrape the public Pinterest board URL.
*   **Output:** A list of image URLs (target: 20-30 images).

**Step 2: The AI Analysis & Generation Chain (using a multimodal model like Gemini)**
*   **2a: Image-to-Description (The "Eyes")**
    *   **Prompt:** *"You are an expert art descriptor. Describe the following image in detail as if for a blind person. Focus on color palette (with hex codes if possible), mood, style (e.g., rustic, modern, minimalist), key objects, textures, and any visible typography."*
    *   **Process:** Loop through each image URL from Step 1.
*   **2b: Description-to-Brief (The "Synthesizer")**
    *   **Prompt:** *"You are a design director. Read the following collection of image descriptions and synthesize them into a single, coherent design brief for a wedding invitation. Your output should be a short paragraph summarizing the overall aesthetic, followed by a list of key motifs, and a primary color palette of 5 hex codes."*
    *   **Process:** Combine all text descriptions from the previous step and feed them into this prompt.
*   **2c: Brief-to-Card (The "Designer")**
    *   **Prompt:** A complex prompt including:
        1.  **Persona:** *"You are a senior graphic designer at kartenmacherei.de..."*
        2.  **Goal:** *"Create a new wedding invitation design based on the provided design brief."*
        3.  **Input:** The design brief from Step 2b.
        4.  **Output Format:** *"Your output MUST be a single JSON object... It must follow this exact structure..."*
        5.  **Examples (Few-shot):** Include 2-3 complete examples of `kartenmacherei.de` cards, formatted in the target JSON structure.

**Step 3: The Structured JSON Output Schema**
*   **The target output for the entire chain:**

```json
{
  "card": {
    "width": 148,
    "height": 105,
    "backgroundColor": "#F5F3F0"
  },
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Einladung zur Hochzeit",
      "font": "Serif",
      "fontSize": 24,
      "color": "#4A4A4A",
      "position": {"x": 10, "y": 15}
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Anna & Markus",
      "font": "Script",
      "fontSize": 36,
      "color": "#C5A48A",
      "position": {"x": 10, "y": 40}
    },
    {
      "type": "image",
      "src": "motif_url_from_ai.png",
      "position": {"x": 70, "y": 60},
      "size": {"width": 50, "height": 30}
    }
  ]
}
```
